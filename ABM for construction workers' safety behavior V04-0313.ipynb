    "## Justification\n",
    "Although, previous variable based research efforts have some light on the effect of group norms on individual's behavior, the mechanisms underlie the link between social influnece and invidual's behavior are still unclear. In addition, variable-based approach may not be sufficient to consider the characteristics inherent in construction and thus a more comprehensive research methodology is required. To address these issues, we will develop agent based model which has strength in generating complex social phenomena as emerging from individuals’interactions"
