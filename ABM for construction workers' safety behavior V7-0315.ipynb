    "## Justification\n",
    "Although, previous variable based research efforts have some light on the effect of group norms on individual's behavior, the mechanisms underlie the link between social influnece and invidual's behavior are still unclear. In addition, variable-based approach may not be sufficient to consider the characteristics inherent in construction (e.g., complex organizational hierarchy) and thus a more comprehensive research methodology is required. To address these issues, we will develop agent based model which has strength in generating complex social phenomena as emerging from individualsâ€™interactions"

    "## Results\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This model aims to present plots that represent how sweeping over changes in project based identity, crew based identity, safety rule strictness, and frequency of safety inspection will result in changes to worker's safety behavior. Thses plots will be heat map plot which can explaint the effect of sweeping conditions on workers' safety behavior.\n",
    "### Hypothetical Results\n",
    "We expect that although there is a strict rule in the project, workers will not change their safety behavior if they do not identify themselves with their project. In addition, it will be more difficult to change worker's safety behavior if workers' level of social identification with their crew membership is higher than that with project membership."
